    "Stata is a Data Analysis and Statistical Software widely used in the social sciences. The ease of the language and strong technical support from Statacorp are some of its biggest advantages over other programming languages. It is a good language for people who aren't familiar with programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "As aspiring Economists/Econometricians, alot of time in your career you will be given data to analyse. Investing the time in learning tools such as Stata will go a **long** way in your career and make life much easier for you."
